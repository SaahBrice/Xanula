   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:


   ```bash
   pip install tailwindcss
   ```

5. **Database Setup**:

   Ensure your database is set up and configure the connection in `settings.py`:

   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
           'NAME': 'xanula_db',
           'USER': 'yourusername',
